User Research
-----------

What problem does your application address, and how does your application address it?

* The need to find a place to eat and the urge to want to try something new

What are the killer features of your application?
* Locate Restaurants, Cafes, Coffee Shops, Bars (21+), etc. nearby user location
* Arrange to meet people at location
* Checklist for Regional
* Coupon from Restaurants

Identify and briefly describe your target demographic. Who do you envision using your site?
* Adolescents, College Students, Young Adults  
* People who love to go out and try new places
* People who are looking for social networking and to meet new people
* People looking to plan dates
* People looking for a way to meet up with friends

Develop at least one use case for your site. This should be a list or table demonstrating a sequence of user actions and website responses that occur when a user attempts to complete a core task on your site. Make sure to indicate the task the user is trying to complete.

Site Design
--------------
Draw out, by hand, three different designs for this page. Scan these for your submission.
Make a list of 3 pros and 3 cons for each design.
* DESIGN A
    - Pros:
        1. Most complete design
        2. Already visited list
        3. Has a scheduler
    - Cons: 
        1. Map is a little small
        2. Not so sure how realizable the idea of people scheduling future meals is
        3. Linear application progress bar is unnecessary


* DESIGN B
    - Pros:
        1. Shows completion percentage
        2. Wish list
        3. Has options for cafes, restaurants, bars
    - Cons: 
        1. Map is too large; no space for everything else
        2. Percentage complete is unnecessary
        3. Doesn’t show restaurants already been to


* DESIGN C
    - Pros:
        1. Shows the option of preferences
        2. Has review submission
        3. Has wish list
    - Cons: 
        1. It’s a little minimalist
        2. Submission box looks bad
        3. UI not self-explanatory

Pick the best design and mock it up using an image editing program (i.e. Photoshop or Gimp) or using HTML/CSS. Submit a screenshot of this mockup.
We chose Design A as our best design. We will likely end up with a combination of Designs A and B in the end.
Minimal Viable Product
--------------
What features do you plan to implement? How critical are they to the proper functioning of your application?
* Google Maps API. Very important to proper functioning.
* Region (zipcode?) percentage checklist to completion
* Wish list. Nice to have goal

What features do you plan to leave out? How critical are they to the proper functioning of your application?
* Facebook (or some general social network) API. Nice to have but not critical to function
* Reviews and Ratings (not super important)
* Sponsors for completion rewards - pretty important for motivation of users

Are there any other aspects of your application that are reduced in your MVP? Examples including limited fake datasets, stylistic concerns, security concerns, etc.
* fake datasets (if we cannot get maps data or at least large amounts of data)
* stylistic concerns (as long as everything is organized but doesn’t have to be that aesthetically appealing yet)
* security concerns (only have developers as users and the user information to access is not really valuable)
